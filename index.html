    "Join me on a journey of entrepreneurship and product management as we explore the exciting world of business and innovation together"
</p> <hr>
<p class="intro"> 
  <b><u>About Me</u></b> <br><br>

My name is Avinash and I am a social entrepreneur and product manager based in Bangalore, India. I am passionate about using my skills and expertise to create innovative products and drive social change, and I am excited to share my experiences and insights with you.
<br><br>
My entrepreneurial journey began with a chance encounter with a visually impaired student, which sparked the idea for Veeery – a company that I am deeply committed to. Over the years, I have built Veeery from the ground up and have had the opportunity to wear many hats – from programmer to salesperson to product manager. I have learned so much along the way and have grown in ways that I never could have imagined.
<br><br>
In addition to my work with Veeery, I also founded the Dharnika Foundation – an NGO that I am proud to be a part of. Working with Dharnika has been a truly rewarding experience, and I have learned so much about team building and leading without authority.
<br><br>
I have been fortunate enough to have the support of so many amazing people along the way, who have inspired me to continue this noble work and push myself to be the best version of myself. My entrepreneurial journey has been an incredibly fulfilling and enriching experience, and I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to pursue something similar in their own lives.
<br><br>
Entrepreneurship is not easy, and it requires hard work, determination, and a willingness to take risks. But if you are willing to put in the effort, the rewards can be immeasurable. I am grateful for every challenge and obstacle that I have faced along the way, as they have helped me to grow and become the person I am today. I am excited to see where my entrepreneurial journey takes me next, and I hope that my story can inspire others to pursue their own dreams and make a positive impact in the world. <br><br>
Thank you for joining me on this journey! <br>
