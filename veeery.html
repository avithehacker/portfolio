"A platform which aims to provide similar reading and learning experience to a visually impaired person which a common has." <br> <br>  

Veeery started when I met with a visually impaired student in 2019, my entrepreneurial journey started from here, I am the Co-Founder and CEO. We grew a team and raised it to 5K monthly active users. I can say that it is some of the fastest three years of learning in my whole life. 

  

 

 
<h2> <u>
My top learning: 
</u></h2>
<p>
In social sector, no matter how noble your work is if you do not generate cash flow your work will not sustain in the long run, so to create the impact, the organization should be in form of sustainable business. We are living in a capitalist economy where we have to seek maximum return for our work.. 
<br> <br>
 

Investors don’t invest in smaller TAM businesses. Everyone needs good returns of their investments, though it is good to create a blue ocean market but it is more important check the size of the market, i.e., to know the size of the market who will be actually using the newly created product. 

 <br> <br>

While creating a B2C product it is best to talk directly to your users. The user can’t share what they exactly want but they cannot hides his needs. Your product should be user-centric.  

  
<br> <br></p>
<h2> <u>
    My work / Role 
</u></h2>
    <p>
In starting days at Veeery I have done everything like visited schools and colleges for surveys, Took customer interviews, and tried to understand consumer needs and behavior. 
<br> <br>
I was the first coder in the company. I used user-centric design (600+ hours of sitting with the visually impaired) to build Veeery.  
<br> <br>
Created many MVPs and tested prototypes with final users. Our users are happy and ready to invest their time in Veeery to test the app. While making the app we failed 7 times but learned after each failure. Later we succeeded and launched the 8th version of MVP in the market.  
<br> <br>
During the expansion of the team I have taken interviews of more than 500+ people and hired 12 core team members and 60+ interns.  
<br> <br>
 

Worked collaboratively and managed a tech team of 12 designers, researchers, and software engineers and successfully added thousands of accessible content.  
<br> <br>
Made Veeery a royalty-free business leading to a 90% cut in the cost, hence making the business model simple and easy to sustain and survive.
