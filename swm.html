   <h2><u> Platform For Solid Waste Management System</u></h2>
   <p>
      <b><u>Author</u></b> <br> Avinash Singh
   </p>
   <p>
      <b> <u>Change History</u></b> <br> Version 1.0 <br> 20 Feb 2022
   </p>
   <p>
       <b><u>Overview of challenges in SWM</u></b> <br> <br>
       
Urban India generates 62 million tonnes of waste (MSW) annually, said a 2014 Planning Commission report. It is also predicted that the volume will increase to 165 million tonnes by 2030. <br> <br>
India’s solid waste collection efficiency, however, is around 70 percent at present, while it is almost 100 percent in many developed countries. <br> <br>
Moreover, 43 million tonnes of municipal solid waste was collected annually, out of which 31 million were dumped at the landfill sites and 11.9 million were treated, the environment ministry said in 2016. <br> <br>
A huge portion of the untreated waste is dumped irregularly on the outskirts of towns or cities, causing groundwater contamination and air pollution. There is, thus, a growing need to detect blind spots in the collection and transportation of waste so that the operation can be made more efficient <br> <br> 
‘For any region, SWM has issues like Non-participation of households, trade & commerce, Lack of sufficient knowledge on benefits of waste segregation at source, Lack of proper & timely communications, No real-time tracking & monitoring of Drivers/Vehicles, Irregular collection, and transportation facility.’  <br> <br>

   </p> <p>
       <b><u>Validation of Challenges</u></b>
       <br> <br>
       The above-mentioned challenges will be validated through primary and secondary data.
Primary data will be collected using questionnaires for surveys of various stakeholders, one-to-one and online, interviewing citizens, and using empathizing techniques to find a better solution.
The secondary data will be used for understanding the volume of impact using data available with government and research centers. This collected data will be used to identify the user and analyze the utility of the solution built.

<br> <br>

The whole process of solution building will be done in the following steps: <br> <br>

   </p>
   <p>
       <b><u>
        Solution
        </u></b>
        <br><br>
        Note: This solution is on the basis of secondary data collected from various government websites. <br> <br>
        
A platform is required in order to assist in keeping the city clean, in which various actors are present, like citizens, vendors, urban local bodies. This platform will also ensure a smooth flow of activities like segregation, collection, transportation & disposal of waste. A smart, integrated waste management system will ensure real-time monitoring of the collection and transportation of waste.
<br> <br>
<b>
    How this will help</b> <br> <br>
If we look at challenges and issues in the waste management system, we can observe that  major causes of these are high amounts of waste generation, non-segregated waste, this leads to lack of space for landfills and a high volume of untreated waste. It is also noted that there are a lot of waste materials that can be reused before even being treated as waste. <br> <br>

There are places and bins where the waste is thrown for months, leading to an increase in diseases in the area and the creation of unapproved/illegal landfills. This happens majorly because the staff is unaware of these newly created landfills and the condition of the bins.
All these causes can be addressed with just aware citizens and staff. An aware citizen will help the system to follow the tunnel of waste management( see below figure), which will eventually lead to a decrease in volume and type of waste generation at source. 
<br> <br>

<br> <br>

An aware staff will help to attain following leading to efficiency in waste management system: <br>
●	Central management & control <br>
●	Operational efficiency & improved service quality <br>
●	Immediate intervention capability through real-time alerts <br>
●	Increased employee productivity <br>
●	Increased customer and citizen satisfaction <br> <br>

   </p>
   <p> <b><u>
    Objective </u></b> <br> <br>
    ●	To develop a platform for SWM to assist the efficiency and smooth flow of activities from the pickup of the waste to the point of disposal. <br>
    ●	To collect data, monitor, and analyze the activities involved in the Solid Waste Management System <br> <br>
    
   </p>
   <p> <b><u>
    Platform for SWM</u></b> <br> <br>
    The platform is divided into 3 parts: a website for ULBs and Vendors, an app for the on-field workforce, and an app for the citizens and activists. <br> <br>
