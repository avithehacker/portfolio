        <p class="italic"> Breaking Down Barriers: The Role of Accessibility in Promoting Inclusion</p>  
      <h6 style="font-family:'Raleway', sans-serif;">24 April 2021</h6>
       <p class="intro">
        In today's fast-paced world, we all have a lot on our plates. We have to focus on work, family, and a host of other responsibilities. But what happens when we have an accident and are suddenly unable to move around easily? For example, if we break our foot, we might find ourselves in the category of "disabled" for a few weeks. Suddenly, we face all sorts of challenges when it comes to moving around and enjoying our lives as we did before.
<br><br>
        But is it really our temporary disability that is causing these problems? No â€“ the root of the issue is our society.
        <br><br>
        You see, our society has never viewed accessibility as a basic need. Sure, we might be disabled for a few weeks, but what about those who are disabled for their entire lives? There are millions of people out there who face these challenges on a daily basis. What are their rights? What do they expect from our society?
        <br><br>
        The answer is simple: some minor changes to our infrastructure. But that's not all. In order to truly make our society accessible, we need to start by changing our mindset. This means raising awareness and increasing knowledge about accessibility, so that everyone can benefit from an environment that is designed with everyone in mind
