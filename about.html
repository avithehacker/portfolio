<p class="italic"> About Me</p>  
 <p class="intro">
  I consider myself very fortunate due to my entrepreneurial journey. When I see my younger self, I think how lucky I am as a person. Without luck, it is never possible what I have done and what I have achieved till now. 
 <br> <br>
  
My entrepreneurial journey started with an accident when I met a visually impaired student. While talking to him, I realized that we are living in 21 century where we are trying to solve every problem with technology. So why cannot we solve the education problem of visually impaired friends? 
  <br> <br>
  In my opinion, everyone should at least try an entrepreneurial journey in his life. In three years, I have built Veeery from scratch. While making Veeery, I shifted my role from coder to a salesperson to a product guy. 
  <br> <br>
  These days I am focusing on my NGO(Dharnika Foundation). Dharnika started at the request of our visually impaired friends. I am so glad that they considered me a worthy person and told me to work in the field of inclusive education and livelihood at Dharnika. In Dharnika, I have learned about team building and leading them without authority. 
  <br> <br>
  While working on Veeery and Dharnika, I met many good people. These people are my inspiration to continue doing these noble works. 
  <br><br>

I know I am a nobody people don't know me by my name or face. I have not created much impact on society, but whatever the little work I have done. All credit goes to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kishore-lala-898465/"> Kishore Sir</a> for their guidance on every stage of my entrepreneurial journey. 
  <br> <br>

  I also want to say a big thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjvsml/"> Rajeev Samuel</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nhungthnguyen/"> Nhung Nguyen</a>. My mentors for helping me in my current learning process.
