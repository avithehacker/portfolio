<p class="italic"><u> About Me</u></p>   <br>
 <p class="intro">
  "I feel incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. When I look back at where I started and all that I've accomplished so far, I am filled with gratitude and pride.
<br><br>
It all began with a chance encounter with a visually impaired student, which sparked the idea for Veeery - a company that I am passionate about and deeply committed to. Over the past few years, I have built Veeery from the ground up, and it has been a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows. Along the way, I have had the opportunity to wear many hats - from programmer to salesperson to product manager - and have grown in ways that I never could have imagined.
<br><br>
In addition to my work with Veeery, I also founded the Dharnika Foundation - an NGO that I am deeply committed to and proud of. Working with Dharnika has been a truly rewarding experience, and I have learned so much about team building and leading without authority.
<br><br>
I have been fortunate enough to have the support of so many amazing people along the way, who have inspired me to continue this noble work and push myself to be the best version of myself. Overall, my entrepreneurial journey has been an incredibly fulfilling and enriching experience, and I believe that everyone should have the chance to pursue something similar in their own lives.
<br><br>
Entrepreneurship is not easy, and it requires hard work, determination, and a willingness to take risks. But if you are willing to put in the effort, the rewards can be immeasurable. I am grateful for every challenge and obstacle that I have faced along the way, as they have helped me to grow and become the person I am today. I am excited to see where my entrepreneurial journey takes me next, and I hope that my story can inspire others to pursue their own dreams and make a positive impact in the world."
<br><br>
I know I am a nobody people don't know me by my name or face. I have not created much impact on society, but whatever the little work I have done. All credit goes to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kishore-lala-898465/"> Kishore Sir</a> for their guidance on every stage of my entrepreneurial journey. 
  <br> <br>

  I also want to say a big thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjvsml/"> Rajeev Samuel</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nhungthnguyen/"> Nhung Nguyen</a>. My mentors for helping me in my current learning process.
