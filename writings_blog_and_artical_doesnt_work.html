        Hello, readers. I am here to answer the above question.
        The first thing you need to know is that the post you are reading is written by a blogger and if that is not the case then it contains only highlighted good stuff.
        Let's talk about two sides of the coin: - A Coin has two sides, one is head, another is tail. Similarly, in a blog, there are two sides. One is the blogger’s side, the other one is yours.
        <br><br>
        Let's talk about your side first: -
        Why do you read any blog posts? Because you want any kind of solution and that solution could change your life or could make your life easy. Then what you do is just google it and you find many blogs related to those answers. Then you read these blogs and get motivated but after a few days, you still do not have the solution. 90% of the people face similar problems. In my case, I have searched for funding-related questions. There are many available answers but nothing works at this time and I don't know what is wrong with that.
        <br><br>
        Now, let's talk about the blogger side: -
        A blogger writes his blog to provide the best solution for you. He tries to give his hundred percent but, even he has some boundaries.
        He has to make his readers happy, he doesn't want his readers to give him any bad feedback, so, what he does is, provide only good stuff, only highlighted things. What I mean here by ‘highlighted things’ is: have you ever listened to any success story of any person? They always tell their story in key points only, stuff which makes their story good, here what matters is good looks. Many bloggers hide harsh truth because if that truth comes out, you will get demotivated. as you are a potential client of that blogger, no one wants an unsatisfied customer.
        <br><br>
        So the conclusion is: -
        If you want to find some solution then you have to take trial and error methods. Try different types of solutions and do not depend on anything. Get some experience from those trial-and-error methods one day you have the better answers. You will have your answers and solutions. The key to success is ‘Don't give up.
        <br><br>
        After reading the conclusion you might get motivated or some positivity might come into you “Hehe” that is exactly what a blogger does, it doesn't matter to anyone what problems you are facing, you have to find the solution on your own.
