        <p class="italic">    Why Most Blog Posts Don't Work for 90% of Readers</p>  
      <h6 style="font-family:'Raleway', sans-serif;">18 April 2021</h6>
       <p class="intro">
        
     
        Are you tired of reading blog posts that promise to provide the solution to your problem, but never deliver? You're not alone. In fact, 90% of readers face similar frustrations. In this post, we'll take a look at both sides of the coin – the reader's perspective and the blogger's perspective – to understand why this is the case.
        <br><br>
        From the reader's perspective:
        <br><br>
        We read blog posts because we're looking for solutions to our problems. We turn to Google and search for answers, and we find plenty of blogs that seem to offer the solution we're looking for. But more often than not, we're left feeling frustrated and disappointed because the solutions provided in these blogs don't work for us.
        <br><br>
        Take funding-related questions, for example. There are countless blogs out there that claim to have the answers to these types of questions, but when you try to follow their advice, you still don't see the results you were hoping for. What's going wrong?
        <br><br>
        From the blogger's perspective:
        <br><br>
        Bloggers write their posts with the intention of providing the best solution to their readers' problems. They try their best to give 100%, but there are always limits to what they can do. Bloggers have to make their readers happy, and they don't want to receive negative feedback, so they often highlight only the good parts of their solution and hide the harsh truth.
        <br><br>
        For example, when you listen to a success story, you'll often hear only the key points – the parts of the story that make it sound good. Bloggers do the same thing, because they don't want to risk demotivating their readers. After all, as potential customers, no one wants an unsatisfied reader.
        <br><br>
        Conclusion:
        <br><br>
        So what can you do if you're tired of reading blog posts that don't deliver on their promises? The solution is simple: try different methods and approaches until you find what works for you. Don't rely on anyone else's solutions, because they may not work for you. The key to success is to keep trying and never give up.
        <br><br>
        Motivated yet? That's exactly what a good blogger aims to do – to provide a little bit of positivity and encouragement, regardless of the problems you're facing. Remember, you have to find your own solutions, and it's up to you to take the trial and error approach until you find what works for you.
