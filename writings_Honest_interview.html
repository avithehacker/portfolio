        <p class="italic">   Why is an honest interview important when building a product?</p>  
      <h6 style="font-family:'Raleway', sans-serif;">18 April 2022</h6>
       <p class="intro">
        
      
        I was the first coder in my company when we started our company with the mission to provide a seamless learning experience to the visually impaired. We didn't know how we were going to do this.
        <br><br>
        So I started interviewing some of my visually impaired friends. My first question was if you have to build any solution to this problem that you are facing then what would be your approach?
        <br><br>
        They all had slightly different approaches/solutions from the others, but they all had similar requirements. As a product person, you have to understand that "a customer doesn't know what he wants but customers can't hide their need."
        <br><br>
        I can say that our product is made by our users we just followed their instructions and written code above those instructions. We have failed seven times following the instructions but our final release gives complete satisfaction to each and every user because they have made it.
        <br><br>
        Whenever you are building something just listen to your user and don't put your biased opinion.
