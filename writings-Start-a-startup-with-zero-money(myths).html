        <p class="italic">   The Myth of Starting a Startup with Zero Money: Why Every Business Needs Investment</p>  
      <h6 style="font-family:'Raleway', sans-serif;">7 June 2022</h6>
       <p class="intro">
        <br>
        Starting a startup can be a daunting task, especially if you have no money to invest in it. Many websites and gurus claim that it is possible to start a startup with zero money, but is this really true?
<br><br>
The simple answer is no. While it is possible to minimize costs and bootstrap a startup to some extent, it is not realistic to expect that you can start a business without any expenses at all. Even a small startup will require some basic resources, such as a laptop, internet connection, and perhaps a microphone if you are starting a podcast.
<br><br>
One of the best times to start a startup is while you are in college, as you may have access to resources such as a network of fellow entrepreneurs and mentors, as well as funding opportunities through your school or local business community. However, it is important to remember that even college projects and side businesses will require some level of investment, whether it be in terms of time, money, or both.
<br><br>
One example of a successful startup that I started in college is Prixfit, a platform that helps farmers connect with buyers and sell their products directly. While this startup may have started as a side project, it required some level of investment in terms of time and resources to get off the ground.
<br><br>
In conclusion, while it may be possible to minimize costs and bootstrap a startup to some extent, it is not realistic to expect that you can start a business without any expenses at all. If you are considering starting a startup, it is important to be realistic about the resources and funding that you will need to get it off the ground and sustain it in the long term.
