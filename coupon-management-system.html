   <h2><u> Building a scalable coupon code management system</u></h2>
   <p>
      <b><u>Author</u></b> <br> Avinash Singh
   </p>
   <p>
   <b> <u>Change history</u></b> <br>
    Version 1.0 <br>
    March, 21 2022, First Draft 
    
   </p>
<p> <b>  <u>Goal</u></b> <br>
Creating a coupon code management system where anyone can easily integrate coupons to give discounts in their app, website or any kind of running platform. This platform has two main goals. The first is to remove dependency on payment platforms for coupons and second is to give the vendors(developers) all in one solution where they can manage all their coupon needs.
</p>
 <p>
     <b><u>Background</u></b> <br>
Coupons are a powerful tool to attract new customers. In a survey by Market track 83% of shoppers have made an unplanned purchase based on a promotion/coupon.  And according to a Valassis coupons report  In comparison to two years ago, there are significantly more consumers who say they always use coupons, driven by an increase in millennials’ frequency of coupon use.

 </p>
 <p>
<b>   <u> Objective</u></b> <br>
    1.	All in one solution for offers, voucher and coupon management. <br>
    2.	Simple and easy integration on all platforms. <br>
    3.	Developer friendly Docs website with good UI. <br>
    4.	Easy ways to create offers, Offer Dashboard, Consumption history, voucher dashboard. <br>
    5.	Freedom while setting discounts and offers. <br>
    6.	Remove dependency on payment gateway. 
    
 </p>
 <p>
    <b><u>Assumptions</u></b> <br>
    ●	The users of this platform are someone who has some basic technical knowledge(programming who can copy paste code and modify it according to his need) of technology, developers and companies. <br>
    ●	The target customers can be individual or/and small, medium or large businesses. <br>
    ●	Only pricing strategy is required for the initial draft. The price of the product will be calculated per cost and after considering all variables. <br>
    ●	Only basic structure for features is required for the initial draft. Any additional or unique features can be added after further discussion. <br>
    ●	Any addition or changes in the features, details or types of coupon or discount will be done post further discussion.
    
 </p>
 <p>
     
<b><u>Types of coupons</u></b> <br>
1.	Percentage Discount:- In this type the discount will be a percentage of the price of a particular product. Eg: 20% off on purchasing safety shoes. <br>
2.	Flat Discount:- These are fixed discounts given on purchase of a particular product. Eg: RS 50 off on purchasing <br>
3.	Item Coupon:- Item coupons can only be applied to items, and will not apply to other line items that are not items in the catalogue. Item coupons can be a fixed amount or a percentage. <br>
4.	Free Trial Coupon:- Free trial coupons can be used to give new subscriptions different free trial lengths.

 </p>
 <p>
     
<b><u>Features Overview</u> </b> <br>
1.	Single code coupons for mass distribution with the option to limit maximum redemptions and or set a specific redeem by date. <br>
2.	Bulk unique codes for individual delivery and tracking. <br>
3.	Discounts at the account level or tied to specific subscriptions. <br>
4.	Coupons that discount one-time non-subscription charges. <br>
5.	Item coupons specific to items from the Item Catalogue. <br>
6.	Percentage discounts or fixed amount discounts in multiple currencies for one coupon. <br>
7.	Free trial coupons to give new subscriptions special free trial lengths. <br>
8.	Offer your discount for one purchase, a limited time, or forever. <br>
9.	Set how many times a customer can redeem a specific coupon. <br>
10.	Limit customers to one active coupon, or allow multiple coupons on their account and purchases. <br>
11.	Ability to edit, expire, and restore coupon campaigns.

 </p>
 <p>
<b>  <u>  How this solution works</u></b> <br>

    This solution works on the final price of the product. <br>
    
    Here are the detailed steps of working:- <br>
    
    Step 1:- Fetch the final price of the product. <br>
    Step 2:- Apply coupon according to needs. <br>
    Step 3:- Modify the price according to the coupon discount. <br>
    Step 4:- Send a modified amount to payment gateways. <br>
    Step 5:- Now you can proceed to pay.

    <br>
<b>    <u>Pricing</u></b> <br> <br>
    The pricing is categorised into two types: Yearly subscription and Customised Pricing. The subscription is yearly because it is perceived that the monthly subscription won’t be able to cover the cost even if it did the price will be high. Also there are chances that there might be huge gaps between the monthly subscription which might lead to an increase in the churn rate of the company. <br> <br>
    Customised Subscription is basically for large firms who might need the platform with extra features or customised features for their businesses. <br> <br>
    Yearly Subscription will have three categories: <br> <br>
    Individual with access to 1 user login(Eg:- someone who sells courses online) <br> <br>
    Small Business with access to 3 - 5 user login (number can be specified per cost) <br> <br>
    Medium/Large Business with access to 7 - 10 user login (number can be specified per cost) <br> <br>
    For every additional user a certain sum can be charged separately per cost. <br> <br>
    Customized Pricing will have fixed pricing per the cost incurred during customisation, and for every additional update a particular sum can be charged. This will allow us to cover the cost incurred during every update. <br> <br>
    For better understanding below is the Pricing strategy in point: <br> <br>
    1.	Yearly Subscription <br>
    ○	Individual - 1 User <br>
    ○	Small Business - 3 - 5 user <br>
    ○	Medium/Large Business - 7- 10 Users <br> <br>
    Note: Xyz amount for every additional user. <br> <br>
    2.	Customized <br>
    ○	Fixed price after considering all variables <br>
    ○	For every Bug fixing/update a nominal amount is charged <br> <br>
