        <p class="italic"> How we fooled our-self (The Misconception of Uniqueness in the Startup World)</p>  
      <h6 style="font-family:'Raleway', sans-serif;">27 May 2022</h6>
       <p class="intro">
        I don't know why we care so much about uniqueness. When I was in class 11th I chose fine art as an optional subject. In that, we all have to copy the same drawing from books. We hated doing that, we wanted to create something new which never has been created, but when our teachers challenged us to create something new, paint your imagination, and make something that never has been created. So what we did was - we drew some paintings and explained it to everyone. Then our teacher told us that art is like a joke. If you have to explain it, then it is not the good one. We never took his word seriously.
<br> <br>
This habit of finding uniqueness remains with us & now, when I am out of my education with no college, no school, no teachers, I am in a school of life. I am a part of a startup ecosystem the scenario remains the same. Whenever I attend startup events, I see many startups and talk to them, the majority of them focus on the uniqueness of the Idea. Some of my friends also has been continuously in search of unique ideas to start a startup, which is usually very hard to find, yet they don't understand that in the end, every startup is a business.
<br><br>
I met with several start-ups and some of them are working on a very unique idea like I used to work on my class 11th paintings - it's hard to explain and you can't tell what they are doing after reading their pitch deck. I always had this question in my mind - do we really need to draw a painting that is hard to understand and takes too much time to explain.
