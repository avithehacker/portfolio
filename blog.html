        I don't know why we care so much about uniqueness. When I was in class 11th I chose fine art as an optional subject. In that, we all have to copy the same drawing from books. We hated doing that, we wanted to create something new which never has been created, but when our teachers challenged us to create something new,  </span>

        When we are in our childhood phase, we always listen to things like - “You are enjoying your best phase of life, no stress, no responsibility, nothing.” But they forget to talk about the privilege children have - 'their teacher', for every problem they have teachers. Teachers have who have answers they can ask as much as they want.  </span>

I was the first coder in my company when we started our company with the mission to provide a seamless learning experience to the visually impaired. We didn't know how we were going to do this.

      We are busy in our own lives and that is absolutely fine. We have to focus on many things but what happens when we meet with an accident? Sometimes our feet get fractured and for a few weeks, we are in the category of disabled persons. Then we face many problems in moving, we cannot enjoy our life like previous ones for a few weeks.  </span>

            Hello, readers. I am here to answer the above question.
            The first thing you need to know is that the post you are reading is written by a blogger and if that is not the case then it contains only highlighted good stuff.
            Let's talk about two sides of the coin: - A Coin has two sides, one is head, another is tail. Similarly, in a blog, there are two sides. One is the blogger’s side, the other one is yours.
