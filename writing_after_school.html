        <p class="italic"> After School</p>  
      <h6 style="font-family:'Raleway', sans-serif;">25 April 2022</h6>
       <p class="intro">
        

        When we are in our childhood phase, we always listen to things like - “You are enjoying your best phase of life, no stress, no responsibility, nothing.” But they forget to talk about the privilege children have - 'their teacher', for every problem they have teachers. Teachers have who have answers they can ask as much as they want.  
        <br>  <br>
        Suppose you are a child and have to learn all the algebra by yourself without your teachers. How much time will it take, how hard is it to learn these things by yourself. After school and college, we can say when the education end, you have to figure things out yourself. Our surroundings (like our friends and relative) helps us to figure out our life problems, but sometimes they are not enough.  
        <br> <br>
        Think about those children who live in a village or tier 3 cities. They don’t know whom to ask or what to ask and some doesn’t even have friends and relatives to support them. This is why we are starting an after-school platform (mentorship and guidance platform where anyone can get mentorship from their seniors in their related fields) at Dharnika Foundation. We invite you to join our mission and become a mentor in your regional language because your mother tongue is more understandable than any foreign language which is more helpful for anyone.
