        <p class="italic">   The incubator role in startup</p>  
      <h6 style="font-family:'Raleway', sans-serif;">14 May 2022</h6>
       <p class="intro">
        
        Many people in 2022 did not know about incubation centers. These places can do wonders for your startup.
<br> <br>
        In 2019 when I was in my hometown, one of my friends invited me to an event(some sort of hackathon). That day for the first time in my life, I was introduced to entrepreneurship. Before that, I had never heard of this word.
        <br> <br>
        When I was in college, I and my friend Anuj faced one problem. We were not able to find any of our coursebooks online. A platform like a Kindle did not have our coursebooks. So I started building one app for ourselves where we can easily get the books we need in the form of an ebook. After a few days, I found that audiobooks are helpful for us, so I built the world's fastest ebook and audiobook app named Veeery.
        <br> <br>
        Many people asked me why this name - Veeery? The answer is when I was starting to build an audiobook app, I just searched for birds and I found Veery bird, its voice is very melodious, hence I picked her name for my app.
        <br> <br>
        This app I presented in front of the incubation center selected me as a startup. At that place, I learned a lot due to my curiosity. At that place, no one was an expert in any field of business. People there usually tried to provide answers to any problem through google search. I left that incubation center and applied at ARTILAB FOUNDATION.
        <br> <br>
        At ARTILAB FOUNDATION I met with Kishore Lala Sir, Mohan Sir, and Pavan Kumar Sir. I have learned a lot from these people. They taught me the correct approach to any problems.Kishore Lala Sir taught me how to think, and how to make a realistic plan. He clearly defined to me - What business is and how to manage a team. The majority of my knowledge came from Kishore Lala Sir.
        <br> <br>
        So I can say that yes incubation center is still worth it if you are new to the field of entrepreneurship. My learning skyrocketed in Bangalore when I joined Artilab. If you have an idea and think that this idea can change the world, but you donâ€™t know anything about startups, then you can join the incubation center, but be sure to apply for the best one. Many startups have grown and come into existence now due to the incubation centers.
