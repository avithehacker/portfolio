This question I always want to answer is how to find a co-founder? The correct answer to this question is that you will find your co-founder by luck. If you are fortunate, then you will find a co-founder easily. 
<br> <br>
I got my co-founder by the network. All my co-founders are my friends or friends of friends whom I can trust. 
<br> <br>
One thing I can tell you is what traits you need in a co-founder.  
<br> <br>
The motive should be the same:- You both have the same motive towards the company. In the early days of startups, many founders don't focus on the company's mission, vision, and goal. I also committed this mistake. Many people joined us for good financial growth, but my vision was to create an impact on society. Many of them left the company in a few months because they had different motives.
<br> <br>
Productivity:- The person should be productive as you. If you are giving your hundred percent, then your co-founder should deliver at least eighty percent. Also, companionship and working ethics affect each other too much as well.
<br> <br>
The missing skills:- Co-founder relationship is like a marriage. Your co-founder should be good at whatever you are lacking. He makes you complete. He bring the skills, which you lack. If you are a tech guy then you should be a sales guy. If he is an idea person, you both should have a plan to execute those ideas, etc.
<br> <br>
Moral support:- Running a startup is a hectic process. You and your co-founder should provide moral support to each other at every step of the entrepreneurial journey. You need a partner who can support you in your hard times and you can aid him in his hard times.
<br> <br>
These traits are enough for a co-founder and all the other things you can learn in several ways. Now the question remains the same how to find a co-founder?
<br> <br>
This process is extremely hard in my experience, but I can share my story of how I did it. I asked my friends to join my startup, and some of them denied it because they had their paths to follow. Then I asked for help from them that if they know someone who could be a good partner, connect me with them. One of my childhood friends Devendra helped me a lot, he completed Veeery and Dharnika as a team, and this is my way my story(or you can say my method) of finding co-founders.
<br> <br>
I don't know what will work for you. You can follow my methods and also you have to do it consistently. You can also try meetups, LinkedIn, and much more networking platforms.
