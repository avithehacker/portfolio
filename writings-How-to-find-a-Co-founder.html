        <p class="italic">Finding the Perfect Co-founder: My Journey and Tips</p>  
      <h6 style="font-family:'Raleway', sans-serif;">8 June 2022</h6>
       <p class="intro">
      <br>
        If you're starting a business, finding a co-founder can be a crucial step. In this blog post, I'll share my own experience of finding co-founders and some tips for others looking to do the same.
<br><br>
        At first, I thought that finding a co-founder was just a matter of luck. But over time, I realized that there are certain traits to look for in a potential co-founder. I ended up finding my co-founders through my personal network - they were all friends or friends of friends that I trusted.
        <br>
        The most important thing is that you and your co-founder have a shared motive for the company. In the early days of a startup, it's common for founders to not focus on the company's mission, vision, and goals. I made this mistake too - I wanted to create an impact on society, but some of the people I brought on board were only interested in financial gain. As a result, they ended up leaving the company after a few months because our motives didn't align.
        <br><br>
        Productivity is also important. If you're putting in 100%, you want your co-founder to be delivering at least 80%. It's also crucial that you have a good working relationship and compatible work ethics.
        <br><br>
        A co-founder relationship is like a partnership or a marriage in that it requires a strong foundation of trust, respect, and mutual support to be successful. It's important to have a complementary skillset with your co-founder, where each of you brings something different to the table. This can help to create a well-rounded and dynamic team that can tackle any challenge that comes your way.
        <br><br>
        If you're a tech-savvy individual, it can be beneficial to have a co-founder who is skilled in sales and marketing, as they can help to drive business development and bring in new customers. On the other hand, if you're more of an ideas person, you may want to partner with someone who has a strong execution mindset and can help bring your ideas to fruition.
        <br><br>
        Overall, the key to a successful co-founder relationship is to find someone who complements your skills and personality, and who you can work well with. By combining your unique strengths and working together towards a common goal, you can create a powerful and effective team that can achieve great things. So, a co-founder should be good at whatever you are lacking to make you complete.
        <br><br>
        Starting a business can be a challenging and stressful experience, and it's important to have a co-founder who provides moral support and encouragement along the way. This means being there for each other during the tough times and offering a supportive ear and words of encouragement when needed. It's important to remember that running a startup is a team effort, and having a supportive partner can make all the difference in helping you stay motivated and focused on your goals. So, it's essential to have a co-founder who is there for you and vice versa, as this will help you both navigate the ups and downs of the entrepreneurial journey with greater ease and resilience.
        <br><br>
        These traits are enough for a co-founder and all the other things you can learn in several ways. Now the question remains the same how to find a co-founder? 
        <br><br>
        This process is extremely hard in my experience, but I can share my story of how I did it. I asked my friends to join my startup, and some of them denied it because they had their paths to follow. Then I asked for help from them that if they know someone who could be a good partner, connect me with them. One of my childhood friends Devendra helped me a lot, he completed Veeery and Dharnika as a team, and this is my way my story(or you can say my method) of finding co-founders. 
<br><br>        
        I don't know what will work for you. You can follow my methods and also you have to do it consistently. You can also try meetups, LinkedIn, and much more networking platforms.
